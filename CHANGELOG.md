## [1.3.0] — 2026-11-14

Phase 6.5 / 6.6 — external-control synchronisation for live performance:

### Added
- **MIDI note actions** — keyboard / pad notes can be learned and assigned
  to five actions (next / previous preset, advance sequence one step,
  sequence play / stop, randomize) alongside the existing CC mapping for
  knobs and faders. Note On only; assignments persist in the browser.
- **MIDI clock sync** — the sequence can follow an external MIDI clock
  (Start / Continue / Stop, BPM detection) with a selectable step
  division, via the new "Sequence Sync" source selector in the Play tab's
  MIDI section. Steps advance through the same path as clicking a
  sequence item, so the internal timer never double-advances.
- **Ableton Link sync** — the same Sequence Sync selector can follow an
  Ableton Link session through a small local bridge
  (`tools/link-bridge/`, a dependency-light Node script bridging the
  Link session to the browser over WebSocket). If the bridge is not
  running the UI degrades gracefully and no steps are driven.
  Interop note: the bridge and its protocol handling are verified, and
  the browser client is verified against the bridge; a joint session
  check against Ableton Live itself is still pending (no Live in the
  build environment).

## [1.2.0] — 2026-11-14

Phase 6 ("ultimate") — five additions on top of the 1.1.0 feature set:

### Added
- **OpenRouter BYOK** — the AI tab now accepts a visitor's own OpenRouter
  API key (called directly from the browser, never via the site relay),
  alongside Groq and Gemini.
- **Global Undo / Redo** — header buttons and Ctrl/Cmd+Z /
  Shift+Ctrl/Cmd+Z step through parameter-config history.
- **Mesh export (OBJ / STL)** — surface layers (membrane, tubes) can be
  exported as mesh files for Blender / 3D printing, in addition to the
  existing point-cloud PLY, SVG, PNG and video exports.
- **Embed player** — `/?embed=1#p=<presetId>` plays a single preset in a
  chrome-free player with play / fullscreen controls, ready to iframe
  into notes and other sites.
- **Kiosk mode** — `/?kiosk=1` runs a canvas-only attract loop with
  auto-rotating presets for unattended exhibition use.

## [1.1.0] — 2026-11-14

### Added
- **Chua catalog integration** — the 4 Chua double-scroll presets (2 GPGPU
  attractor, 2 motion) join the generated collection: **746 → 750 presets**,
  each with a catalog thumbnail, a share page and a per-preset JSON. New
  "Chua" series in the preset shelf and the catalog.
- `<meta name="description">` on the app entry page.
- English overview section in the README.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-11-14

First tagged release: the live site at https://monosphere.pages.dev/ as of
2026-11-14, with its full source published in this repository.

### Highlights
- Four-edge UI (slim header / left rail / right preset shelf / bottom deck +
  expandable sheet), Basic / Pro modes — the canvas centre is never covered
- Built-in library of 444 presets + generated collection of 746 presets with
  real thumbnails, lazy-loaded into the shelf (series: Coverage, Ignition,
  Theory, Lenia, Particle Life, DLA, L-System, Raymarch, Audio FFT)
- Chua circuit (double-scroll attractor) as both a scene motion and a GPGPU
  attractor type
- Evolution Lab (crossover / mutation), parameter timeline & morphing
  playback, partial preset apply & blending
- AI tab: natural-language preset generation and parameter control
  (BYOK: Groq / Gemini, direct from the browser; optional site relay)
- Optional cloud sync of user presets (Neon Postgres)
- Every preset has a share page with OGP cards; the site ships robots.txt
  and sitemap.xml (748 URLs); the Pages worker returns real 404s for
  missing files while keeping the SPA fallback for app routes
- Platform features: Wake Lock, Document Picture-in-Picture, Web Share,
  PNG clipboard copy, fullscreen, PWA

### Notes
- Not yet in this repo: `.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml` and the binary
  PWA icon PNGs under `public/` (the live deployment includes both).
